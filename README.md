<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is Scummy?

[![Scummy][scummy-gallery]](https://j-topia.com/images/scummy_gallery.png)

Scummy is a well designed, clean, and modern front-end for SCUMMVM. For those who aren't familiar, SCUMMVM is an application which allow you to run classic graphic adventure and roleplaying games on modern systems. It is a fantastic application that has given many a chance to relive their childhood favorites, with minimal fuss.

A list of resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

### We need help!
Currently Scummy is being developed on a machine running Windows, but we purposely chose a cross-platform framework in which to develop it. We need help in the following areas:
* Mac-specific code and/or the ability to test on a Mac.
* Linux-specific code and/or the ability to test on Linux.
* Translations into other languages.
