# NOTE: Discontinued.

## The ScumMVM team has announced that one of the projects for the 2021 Google Summer of Code is to "improve the GUI by adding a graphical interface for game library management, so that games are displayed with cover art thumbnails, grouping options and various filtering fields." Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

## Needless to say, this will offer everything Scummy was trying to offer, but built right into ScummVM. Effective immediately, I am halting development on Scummy. Thanks for anyone that stopped by!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is SAGE?

[![SAGE][sage-gallery]](https://j-topia.com/images/sage_gallery.png)

SAGE is a well designed, clean, and modern front-end for SCUMMVM. For those who aren't familiar, SCUMMVM is an application which allow you to run classic graphic adventure and roleplaying games on modern systems. It is a fantastic application that has given many a chance to relive their childhood favorites, with minimal fuss.

A list of resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

### We need help!
Currently SAGE is being developed on a machine running Windows, but we purposely chose a cross-platform framework in which to develop it. We need help in the following areas:
* Mac-specific code and/or the ability to test on a Mac.
* Linux-specific code and/or the ability to test on Linux.
* Translations into other languages.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You've checked out SAGE and would like to contribute? Great! Here's how to set up a working copy locally.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jharrels/SAGE.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Startup SAGE from the repo
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
Version 1.0 of SAGE will be able to do everything SCUMMVM can do plus a few extras:
* **0.1.0** - ~~Obtain a list of installed games.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.2.0** - ~~Display the list of installed games using either a grid view or a list view.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.3.0** - ~~Install games via Scummy, including detecting an uninstalled game or a new version of an installed game.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.4.0** - ~~Ability to configure options for installed games.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.5.0** - ~~Launch games, including different versions of games.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.6.0** - ~~Remove installed games.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.7.0** - ~~Favoriting of games.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.8.0** - ~~Set default games.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.9.0** - ~~Display options for displaying recently played, all games, favorited games, and games by category (ie. LucasArts, Sierra, Delphine Software, etc).~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.10.0** - ~~GUI configuration options for Scummy.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **0.11.0** - ~~Get automated builds working.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **1.0.0** - ~~Release.~~ :heavy_check_mark:
* **1.1.0** - Scummy becomes SAGE. Add compatibility to ScummVM 2.9.0, missing box art.

Planned features:
* Organize games into player-made collections (for example: RPGs, Monkey Island, King's Quest, etc).
* Launch other applications before launching the game. Useful for setting up other devices, such as virtual drives or MT-32 emulation.
* Search function.
* Additional game information.
* Recording total time played for games.
* Themes.
* Add additional game options.
* Add SCUMMVM configuration options.
* Add compatibility for Mac.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jharrels/SAGE/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
