<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is Scummy?

[![Scummy][scummy-gallery]](https://j-topia.com/images/scummy_gallery.png)

Scummy is a well designed, clean, and modern front-end for SCUMMVM. For those who aren't familiar, SCUMMVM is an application which allow you to run classic graphic adventure and roleplaying games on modern systems. While it is a fantastic application that has given many a chance to relive their childhood favorites, I find the user interface a little old school.

Why didn't I just contribute to the SCUMMVM project? Because I am a horrible C/C++ developer and quite honestly, I wasn't sure what I was looking at when I snagged the source code. I am used to working with web technologies, so I thought about providing a front-end for those who would like to use one as a way of giving back to the SCUMMVM community.

A list of resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
