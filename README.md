<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is Scummy?

[![Scummy][scummy-gallery]](https://j-topia.com/images/scummy_gallery.png)

Scummy is a well designed, clean, and modern front-end for SCUMMVM. For those who aren't familiar, SCUMMVM is an application which allow you to run classic graphic adventure and roleplaying games on modern systems. It is a fantastic application that has given many a chance to relive their childhood favorites, with minimal fuss.

A list of resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
Version 1.0 of Scummy will be able to do everything SCUMMVM can do plus a few extras:
* ~~Obtain a list of installed games.~~ :shipit:
* Display the list of installed games.
* Allow configuration of installed games.
* Allow configuration of SCUMMVM default settings.
* Allow launching of games, including different versions of games.
* Remove installed games.
* Allow favoriting of games.
* Display options for displaying recently played, all games, favorited games, and games by category (ie. LucasArts, Sierra, Delphine Software, etc).

Planned features:
* Organize games into player-made collections (for example: RPGs, Monkey Island, King's Quest, etc).
* Launch other applications before launching the game. Useful for setting up other devices, such as virtual drives or MT-32 emulation.
* Search function.
* Additional game information.
* GUI configuration options for Scummy.
* Recording total time played for games.
* Themes.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jharrels/scummy/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
